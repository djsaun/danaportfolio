	<p>I graduated Magna Cum Laude in three years from Chico State with my Bachelor's degree in Liberal Studies and a minor in Special Education. I am currently in my credential year, obtaining my Multiple Subject Teaching Credential in May 2014. My work ethic mixed with my zeal and excitement for teaching has lead me to this incredible profession. Education and teaching has always been the biggest passion of mine; as I have known I have wanted to be a teacher since I was in the third grade. I cannot wait to begin my journey as an educator, make a difference in the minds of young students, and create a zest in their lives for learning.</p>
